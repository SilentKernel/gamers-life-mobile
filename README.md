# Gamer's Life Mobile WebApp

This repository is the Angular 1 / ionic 1 application made for https://gamers-life.fr made two years ago (middle / end of 2015).
It was my first project with  Angular / Ionic 

Today it would be great to update it with Ionic 2 (Or React Native ?) but i don't currently have enought time to do so

### Installation

```sh
$ nom -g install cordova ionic
$ npm install
$ ionic platform add android
$ ionic platform add ios #Mac user only
$ ionic state reset
$ sh concatejs.sh
```

### Run

It's better to run this app in mobile emulator cause this app use native functionality

```sh
$ ionic run ios # Mac User only
$ ionic run android -l -c # Live reload + console, for android
```
